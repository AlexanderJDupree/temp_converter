Simple command line application that converts temperature units

usage:
  ftoc [<temperature>] options

where options are:
  -V, --version                  Show version and quit
  -i, --input <input units>      Sets the input units
  -o, --output <output units>    Sets the output units
  -?, -h, --help                 display usage information

Available units:
  Celsius
  Fahrenheit
 
Notes:
  The application is named 'ftoc' as this leisure project started out as a Fahrenheit TO Celsius converter only. 
  The purpose of 'ftoc' was to brush up on my CLI skills in C++ as well as learn the wonderful parsing utility 'clara'.
  Experimenting with clara and newer C++ features is what expanded ftoc into a full featured temperature conversion utility.
  However, the name 'ftoc' still persists as I have not yet come up with a better name for the application.
